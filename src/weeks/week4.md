## How to break an industrial grade laser cutter in 6 easy steps

1. Spend an hour and a half figuring out how to turn it on
2. Cook for 8 hours
3. oops- I meant 3 steps

Last Saturday, I did a study session with Alissa in the loop, things started off going well
as we worked on designs and got ahead on reading. After a few hours, we went downstairs to the IRL
and began cutting out a few test cubes to measure kerf and optimize the cut. At its lowest,
we got the kerf down to 0.01mm, but weren't able to reproduce the settings which created it.
