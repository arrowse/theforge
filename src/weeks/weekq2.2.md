You've seen the david discord emote. It's great. We love it.

How can it get any better?

By turning it into chocolate of course. But Ice is easier to clean, so we'll start with that for now.

### Step 1. Trick the professor into 3d scanning his face

I asked him politely if I could scan his face for a random and unrelated project, not at all connected to the
molding assignment. Little did he know... I used an advanced technique called lying.. IT WAS FOR MOLDING AND CASTING
ASSIGNMENT! AH HA HA HA HA

He actually volunteered to do so himself when he had some time free, which was very kind and helpful.

### Step 2. Make a positive wax mold

After importing the file into FreeCad it crashed, even with a few more attempts it didn't appear to load properly, so I asked
Alisa if I could borrow her laptop to try running it through Fusion, which ran quite slowly. The model appeared to have
over 1.1 million polygons, which is a few more than most laptops can handle...

Alisa let me try reducing the model on her laptop, after which it still took about 10 minutes per operation in Fusion 360, so I worked on assignments for other classes while it did
its thing following [this tutorial on creating molds in Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKZx9eHEL6o). Eventually I had to go, progress was slow, so I decided to ask for help.

Matthew suggested using the decimate modifier in Blender _before_ importing the model into CAD, which worked like a charm!

### Step 2. Attempt 2 (now in FreeCAD)

I imported the model, converted it from a mesh to a solid, then closed any remaining open gaps using the solidify tool.
