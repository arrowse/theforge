<subscript>A quick note: I jumped in during the second quarter,
so for this week I was given an alternative assignment to finish getting up to speed.</subscript>

In the infamous words of the [Portal 2 tutorial voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw_HozTyCvI), "when you hear the
buzzer, stare at the art" *extremely loud incorrect buzzer*

You might have seen my previous instance of an extremely loud incorrect buzzer [here](/weekq2.0), well I'm glad
to say it was foreshadowing!
