## How to break an industrial grade laser cutter in 6 easy steps

1. Spend an hour and a half figuring out how to turn it on
2. Cook for 8 hours
3. oops- I meant 3 steps

Last Saturday, I did a study session with Alissa in the loop, things started off going well
as we worked on designs and got ahead on reading. After a few hours, we went downstairs to the IRL
and began cutting out a few test cubes to measure kerf and optimize the cut. At its lowest,
we got the kerf down to 0.01mm, but weren't able to reproduce the settings which created it.

We eventually got it close enough though, and started a cut session.

The laser had other plans.

About 3/4ths of the way through the cut, the laser started flickering, then
cut out completely.

So yeah, we cooked an industrial grade laser cutter today. How are you doing?
