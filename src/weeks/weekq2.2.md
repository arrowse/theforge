You've seen the david discord emote. It's great. We love it.

How can it get any better?

By turning it into chocolate of course. But Ice is easier to clean, so we'll start with that for now.

### Step 1. Trick the professor into 3d scanning his face

I asked him politely if I could scan his face for a random and unrelated project, not at all connected to the
molding assignment. Little did he know... I used an advanced technique called lying.. IT WAS FOR MOLDING AND CASTING
ASSIGNMENT! AH HA HA HA HA

He actually volunteered to do so himself when he had some time free, which was very kind and helpful.

### Step 2. Make a positive wax mold

After importing the file into FreeCad it crashed, even with a few more attempts it didn't seem to cooperate, so I asked
Alisa if I could borrow her laptop to try running it through Fusion, which ran quite slowly. The model appeared to have
over 1.1 million polygons,
after reducing it the performance issues were resolved and I could turn it into a mold!

It still took about 15 minutes per operation in Fusion 360, so I worked on assignments for other classes while it did
its thing following [this tutorial on creating molds in Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKZx9eHEL6o).
