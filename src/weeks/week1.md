## Hi! I'm a very serious and professional developer...

I write articles about windows being incompetent, covered my old family home in dumb
paper contraptions, and broke an industrial laser cut- I mean happened to be
in the vicinity of an industrial grade laser cutter when it just so happened to break down...

In a nutshell, I'm a very qualified and professional developer.. and I don't like AP classes (my ass took Community
College courses instead, so I fear
I am not _traditionally_ qualified for this course)

## I'm here now!

I have no clue how but hi! I exist and will do my best to not burn the place down
while making uncooked bread or something related

If you would like to learn more about me, feel free to say hi anytime!

You can also check my [website](https://autumn.onl) for projects, articles and indy web links.

Until next time, I'll catch you on the flipside!
