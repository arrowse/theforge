I have a tendency to work on projects with frameworks I'm already familiar with rather than breaking into new territory,
early on in my brainstorming process I found many of the ideas I was coming up with were overly focused on software, so
to push myself I decided to limit myself to a mechanical public art display.

Given my love for sea life, what better than jellyfish?

## The first fish to fry

To avoid starting too big, I decided to make a mini-jellyfish implementing the most important mechanics,
namely the motor and dimmable lights. To start, I made a small tower out of cut acrylic and took a motor model we worked
with
for our pinwall project from Leah to handle the up-down mechanic.

With the help of a few friends, we painted and cut coffee filters to create the body of a jellyfish!

Moving forward, I would like to design a new motor layout to create a bit more movement. While I've worked with servos
so far, I might
take another stab at using stepper motors, which have proven to be a challenge so far.

For now though, the Servo works, and I have an LED turning on and off in sync with it!

All I need to do now is thread the LED into the head and hang it up!

### Up next:

For this next week, I'll create a larger display hanging from a wooden frame to welcome people to the classroom.
If that goes well, hopefully I can create a larger display to hang in the back room!
